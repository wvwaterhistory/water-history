        <p class="left">A chemical spill poisoned the drinking water of approximately 300,000 West Virginians on January 9th, 2014. Many were without potable water for weeks – for some it was months. On January 9th, and still today, drinking water in the 9 county area was coming not from a municipal source, as with most of the United States, but a private corporation – West Virginia American Water. Today, very little has changed, physically or legally, in this West Virginian water system.</p>

        <h4>West Virginia American Water is a water utility. In the Charleston, WV, area, it provides water to people in 9 counties, often using public funds to expand its system. During the water crisis, many were surprised to learn that there were 300,000 people on a single drinking water intake.  How did we get to this point in history?</h4>

            <h5><strong><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal Camps and Conglomeration</strong></h5>
            <p>Historically, utility services were all very localized. In southern West Virginia, coal companies provided utilities such as electricity, but water was often a personal issue – that meant people used wells and streams. When telephone companies came, they set up telephone interchanges but they weren’t interconnected together. It was only through the 1930s, 40s, &amp; 50s that there was a movement towards consolidation in utilities.</p>
            <p>A larger electric company, for example, would gobble up localized services, shut down the old local generators, and connect them with transmission lines to larger more central power plants, usually on large rivers because of access to coal by barge.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h5><strong><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;FDR and a Mandate for Universal Coverage</strong></h5>
            <p>Federal policy in the 1930s, The New Deal, had brought electric and telephone coverage to rural areas. The Rural Electrification Service had the first mandated goal of universal electric utility service. By the end of the 1960s and 70s, the US had achieved universal service with electricity and telephone. Regulated utility companies could use their margin of profit in urban areas to expand to uneconomically viable rural areas. Remote areas used cooperatives, a legacy of the New Deal.</p>
            <p>Water remained a local service, typically provided by a local municipality. There was little interest in providing water to people outside municipal boundaries (because laying pipe is expensive.) The electorate that elected the board of directors of public water utilities would complain if they had to charge more because of covering uneconomic areas. At the time there were only a small amount of private water systems in West Virginia – West Virginia Water Service Company (which became West Virginia Water Company in the 1960s and West Virginia American Water when bought in the 1980s), for example, Beckley Water, etc.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">  
            <h5><strong><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Legislation</strong></h5>
            <p>In the 1960s congress enacted legislation and funding mechanisms to establish rural water districts – Public Service Districts. More grants and loans for water and sewer came with the Clean Water Act in 1970. West Virginia passed statutes for counties to create Public Service Districts (PSDs) to serve areas outside of municipal boundaries. Many of these initial districts were too small to function and larger PSDs subsumed them in the 70s. They used federal funding systems, because there was no indigenous economic system to pay for upfront capital cost for providing water to remote places like Boone County, in the heart of the southern WV coalfields. For the next 30 years there was substantial funding for water and sewage systems.</p>
            <p>Those grants and loans are gone, for the most part. Municipalities are under their own pressures to upgrade water treatment and distribution systems to new EPA standards, and to replace aging infrastructure, which is why they have turned towards the private sector, toward West Virginia American Water.</p>

            <p>In 1976 WVWC finished an expensive and large water treatment plant on the Elk River, replacing the three plants they had servicing the Charleston area from the Kanawha River. Hoping in part to serve industrial customers, rates were too high to attract large-scale private buyers. That meant they needed more retail residential customers.</p>

             <p>In the 1980s, the company changed its name to WV American Water Company. Then President Chris Jarrett launched an aggressive expansion strategy, pushing to take over small municipal systems and public rural systems. Some of these take overs were amicable, but they also could turn quite hostile when the municipality was not willing. At the time, WV American Water owned treatment plants all over the state  .  They were expanding from three facilities in Fayette County and Summers County, but the biggest push was the expansion from the Elk River plant, in Charleston: that meant enveloping the entire Charleston area, as well as south, into Boone County, and west into Putnam County.</p>

            <p>With such a history of chemical spills in the Charleston area, West Virginia American Water has always known about the risks to their drinking water source. In the 1970s they closed their intakes on the Kanawha River after investigations of serious water quality contamination. At their Elk River facility, they formerly had upstream contaminant monitoring equipment. The German water conglomerate (RWE) owned American Water for a short period in the 2000s. They appear to have removed their gas chromatographs - technology that would have detected the January 9th, 2014 chemical spill.</p>

        <p>The 2014 water crisis did indiscriminately pollute hundreds of thousands of people’s drinking water. However, the way people were able to cope with that crisis was determined by their economic and geographic position. This was because of the inability of people in poverty and in rural areas to drive distances to pick up water from distribution points. Elderly people also were without effective access to clean water, while effective water distribution remained entirely inadequate for close to a month, some estimate.</p>

The initial places for the water distribution were such that if you didn’t have transportation it would be hard for you to get water because you could only carry it so many blocks. We believe that many people in this community probably did use the water when they were advised not to use it, because they just could not get enough water.”</p>

And maybe the chlorine was ok, and the fluoride, and the other stuff they put in it. But it’s better than what we had, or we thought it was. And when that [spill] happened, a friend calls me, and she’s like: “We’ll just do what we done before – we’ll take short quick showers, and buy bottled water to drink with, and to cook with.” She said, “We’ve been through this, we already know what to do. The people in Charleston’s the ones that’s gonna have a hard time. We’ve already learned to cope with it.” So we did.</p>

        <h4>The future of a water system in the West Virginia American Water service area is uncertain. In places like West Virginia, change comes hard. Change comes slow. However, committed activists are working to create a safer water system at the Advocates for a Safe Water System, while a host of public policy groups in West Virginia champions water safety.</h4>
        <p class="top-space">One direction groups, led by groups like Advocates for a Safe Water System and WV Rivers Coalition, are taking to create change is to pressure the Public Service Commission to regulate the water company more effectively. The Commission has the authority (State Code Ch. 24, 2-7) to correct the practices of a utility that it finds to be inadequate or insufficient. However, the Public Service Commission has yet taken any actions since the January 9th 2014 spill, while continuously delaying their formal investigation of the event. However, with industry-regulator connections so strong and amicable, it seems unlikely that real action will come from regulation of the existing utility company. <span class="white">Perhaps it is time for a public water system in southern West Virginia.</span></p>
        <p>Public funds already provide very substantial support to West Virginia American Water. A public water system would have public safety and service as its first goal, not a profit margin. The system would be more transparent to the public, facilitate easier implementation of monitoring standards, and keep ratepayers’ investments here in West Virginia.</p>
        <p>That’s not to say that public ownership itself is the solution. We have seen so many small, underfunded and unsustainable water systems service terrible water to West Virginians for years, ultimately selling out to WVAW. However, large public water systems are sustainable, across the country and here in West Virginia. The Putnam PSD and the Morgantown Utility Board are both good examples. They have responded drastically to the chemical spill on the Elk River, learning from the crisis and exceeding the requirements of SB 373 (the Above Ground Chemical Storage Tank legislation), while WVAW has consistently maintained they did nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>But to get a public water system in Charleston, WV, we’ll have to fight for it.</p>

But there is still organizing and education that needs to happen to really engage people over a sustained period of time, to get the change that his community needs.”</p>

          <p>“In this moment we really have an opportunity to create, to break free from dependency. We are a welfare state, and we can break free from that. But not without industry. And I don’t see an aggressive dialog about what our next industry will be</p>
          <p>…All [we’re] talking about is coal. Can’t we do anything else? It’s sad. I think it will be more of a creative revolution that will put West Virginia, as part of a new Appalachia, back on the map. But I don’t see things significantly changing until the coal conversation can’t happen anymore.</p>
          <p>Coal distracts people – it’s such an emotionally charged thing.</p>
          <p>You don’t always get your ticket to the ball when you’re part of this anti-coal rhetoric. But I don’t see myself anymore as anti-coal as I see myself as black or white. I mean, my racial make-up is that my mom is white and my dad is black. So, I claim an identity in both. I claim an identity as an African American because that’s the box I’m forced in from others. And I feel the same way in this coal dialog. It’s not an either or.</p>
