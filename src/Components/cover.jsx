        <h3>A chemical spill poisoned the drinking water of approximately 300,000 West Virginians on January 9th, 2014...</h3>
        <p>Many were without potable water for weeks – for some it was months. On January 9th, and still today, drinking water in the 9 county area was coming not from a municipal source, as with most of the United States, but a private corporation – West Virginia American Water. Today, very little has changed, physically or legally, in this West Virginian water system.</p>
