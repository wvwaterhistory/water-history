# water-history

Start the app locally
```
npm run dev
```

This will run webpack to build the site. Navigate to `file:///Users/wherever/repo/lives/water-history/index.html` in the browser to view the page.


Deployment
Copy the `index.html`, `resources.html`, the `bundle/` directory, and any images to the s3 bucket where the site is hosted. 
Clear cache and new website content should be immediately accessible.
